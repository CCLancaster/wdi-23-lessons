#### Exercise 5: BONUS

Write a Mad Lib program. Find a paragraph from a news article or a review (a short one) and paste it into your script into a variable. Change it to be an f-string and then choose a few words that you will let the user replace. For each of these words:

1. Identify the type of word it is (noun, adverb, adjective, etc.) and create a variable to hold that submitted word. If you have more than one of one type, just append a number to the variable name.

2. Replace the word in the string with that variable using the proper f-string syntax.

3. Write an input prompt for eeach variable, asking the user for a word of that type.
