## Framing (5 min)

HTML was created as a document-oriented language. CSS emerged as a way to use language to precisely define stylistic features in a way that wouldn't clutter the semantic content or worse destroy the semantic value all together. CSS pursued the related goal of normalizing styling across browsers. In many ways it achieves this goal well; yet it remains one of the most frustrating parts of web development.

It's difficult to establish new CSS standards. The [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) works to further the language of CSS, but with competing views of the members and the problem of cross-browser consistency, this can take considerable time.  

Alignment has traditionally been one of the key contributors to this aggravation. In the last decade, the importance of alignment has sky rocketed.

> Why might this be?

Today we'll be learning about two modern CSS tools to help with making an easier-to-write and more versatile website layout.  

Flexbox, a layout mode introduced with CSS3, is at this point widely implemented across different browsers. CSS Grid, an even newer layout mode which borrows from the best parts of CSS bootstrap, is also becoming popular.  It is not as widely implemented as Flexbox but it does work on most modern browsers.

## Problem 1: Vertical Alignment (15 minutes)

Let's start out by talking about a problem that anybody who has written CSS has likely dealt with:

**I have a `div`. I would like to center it vertically and horizontally on my page.** 

#### You Tell Me: What Should I Try?

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div> Div 1 </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: #990012;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>These might work...</strong></summary>

  > **Padding**: The simplest approach would be to set equal padding on the top and bottom of the container (body) element. We would need to know the exact height of the element and container in order to get this exactly right. This can also get tedious when there is more than one element in a container.
  >
  > **Margin**: Similarly, we could add some margin to the element we are trying to center. The same issues remain.
  >
  > **Absolute Positioning**: You could use properties like `top` and `left` to position an element in the center. This, however, removes it from the document flow.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>These could work in other scenarios...</strong></summary>

  > **`line-height`**: When vertically centering a single line of text, you can set the line-height to that of the whole container.
  >
  > **`vertical-align`**: Used to align words within a line of text (e.g., superscript, subscript).

</details>

The tough part is that how to vertically center a element depends on its context meaning that an element has to look to its parent and then align itself; siblings start to make this very difficult. Depending on your situation, one or more of the above techniques could work. [Here's an enlightening post on the matter](https://css-tricks.com/centering-in-the-unknown/).

### Flexbox to the Rescue

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## How It Works (10 min / 3:00)

![flexbox diagram](img/flexbox-diagram.jpg)

When you declare `display: flex;` in a CSS rule, whatever is targeted by that rule becomes a **flex container**.

The flexbox approach differs from the methods described in the CodePen above in that the arrangement of elements is managed by the **parent** container. The child of a **flex container** is called a **flex item**. We can change the way flex items display by setting item-specific properties that will come later in the lesson.

After the `display` property, the most important flexbox property to understand is `flex-direction`. It is very important to remember that the `flex-direction` orients **flex container's main-axis**. The main axis can set to run vertically or horizontally depending on the value of `flex-direction`. All other flex-related properties are defined in terms of the main axis.

First, use `flex-direction` to indicate whether you want the flex items in the container to "read" left-to-right (`row`), right-to-left (`row-reverse`), top-to-bottom (`column`), **or** bottom-to-top (`column-reverse`).

| flex-direction | main-axis start |
|----------------|-----------------|
| row (default)  | left            |
| column         | top             |
| row-reverse    | right           |
| column-reverse | bottom          |

The `justify-content` property aligns content relative to the **main axis**. Possible values are: `flex-start` (default), `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

> What do you think each does; does the flex-direction affect this?

The `align-items` property is similar to `justify-content` but aligns relative to the **cross-axis**. There are similar options here: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch` (default), and `baseline` (items are aligned by their baselines / where the text is).

By default, a **flex container** will arrange its children in a single row or column. The `flex-wrap` property can modify this with the values `nowrap` (default), `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.

When text is wrapping, `align-content` controls how the rows or columns are arranged relative to the cross-axis: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `stretch` (default), `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

### In Summary...

| Property | What's It Do? | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **display**  |               | `flex`   |
| **[flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction)** | Sets the directional flow of flex items | `row`, `column` |
| **[justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content)** | Align along main axis | `center`, `space-between` |
| **[align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)** | Align along cross-axis | `flex-start`, `center` |

## Problem 2: Make the Footer Stick (10 min / 3:10)

I want my footer to lie along the bottom of my page. Once I've accomplished that, I want to evenly distribute the content boxes horizontally inside of the `<main>` element.

![flexbox layout](img/flex-box-example2.png)

#### You Tell Me: What Should I Try?

```html
<html>
  <header>
    FlexBox
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>Content 1</section>
    <section>Content 2</section>
    <section>Content 3</section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    This is the Footer
  </footer>
</html>
```

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font: 12pt Comic Sans MS;
}

header, footer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 30px;
  background: #000000;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 30px;
}

main {
  background: #D3D3D3;
}

section {
  width: 100px;
  background: #990012;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}
```

Making the footer lie against the bottom of the screen is pretty easy: just use absolute or fixed positioning. However, using absolute or fixed positioning means everything else on the page ignores my footer. The text of `<main>` could easily run under the footer. We want the text to "push" the footer to the end of the page.

### Flexbox to the Rescue

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font: 12pt Comic Sans MS;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is main axis of the `body` oriented here? What about the cross-axis?</strong></summary>

  > Main: vertically, Cross: horizontally

</details>


Now let's horizontally distribute the `<section>` elements containing the page's content inside of the `<main>`. What element should we style?

```CSS
main {
  background: #D3D3D3;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

## CSS Grid

### What is CSS-Grid Layout? (5 min)

From the [www.w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) website...

"Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike Flexible Box Layout, which is single-axisâ€“oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts: those in which alignment of content is desired in both dimensions."

With Grid layout, you can divide up the screen into `rows` and `columns` of sizes of your choosing, and then specify how many rows and columns each `cell` takes up. Sizings can be fixed, or dynamic, allowing you to create modern looking, versatile websites.  

*Example of **flexbox** layout*

![flex layout example](img/flex-layout-ex.png) 

*example of **grid** layout*

![grid layout example](img/grid-layout-ex.png)
> Notice how the grid layout allows the cell on the right to take up multiple rows.  

## All the pieces of a Grid (5 min)

When you look at a grid you see that it has **grid rows** and **grid columns**. Inside these rows and columns are **grid cells**. **Grid tracks** are one or more cells in a line in one rown or column.  Easy, right?

The next concept is **grid areas**. Any group of adjacent grid cells can be sectioned into a **grid area**. We have the ability to give these areas names like we give our variables and link them through styles to our HTML containers.

## What we'll be making

We will implement this basic web page template:

![basic web template](https://i.imgur.com/mYxUzjl.png)

## The code for the Grid

We start with defining a container by setting the `display` property to `grid`. Since we are making a whole page layout we will use the `body` as our container:

```css
  body {
    display: grid;
    min-height: 100%;
  }
```

All of our rows and columns will be inside this. We'll make it fill the full vertical space of the screen.

```html
<body>
  <header></header>
  <aside></aside>
  <main></main>
  <footer></footer>
</body>
```

Now looking at the layout, if you extend all lines to the outermost container boundary, you will see the structure of the grid. Imagine that the left-center section was the middle part of a column that went from top to bottom. In that structure, the header and footer actually span two columns. We will see how to do that but first we must set up the rows and columns.

## Code for the rows and columns

Our layout has 3 rows and 2 columns. We should note that the header and footer have a fixed height and the main fills the remaining space between them. Likewise, the aside will have a fixed width and the main will fill the rest of the space to the right.

First, we'll define the rows and columns:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  min-height: 100%;
  grid-template-rows: 200px 1fr 120px;
  grid-template-columns: 180px 1fr;
}
```

The `fr` is a **fractional unit** and saying `1fr` results in that area in the grid taking up 100% of the remaining space.

## Linking HTML containers to Grid Areas

We have our header, aside, main, and footer and each will be mapped to one **grid area**. Here is how we do that:

```css
header {
  grid-area: header;
}
aside {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
main {
  grid-area: main;
}
footer {
  grid-area: footer:
}
```

We do not put quotes around these identifiers.

## Laying out the Grid Areas

We can now add the CSS to layout our grid areas in the grid. There are a couple different ways of doing this but the way I like the most is using the `grid-template-areas` property because it gives you a nice way of visualizing your areas on top of the grid. Observe:

```css
body {
  ...
  grid-template-areas: "header header"
                       "sidebar main"
                       "footer footer";
}
```

That looks truly bizarre, doesn't it? The syntax is definitely bizarre but it is perfectly legal and allows us to visually represent our grid in code. Rows are represented by each of those strings and columns are shown inside the row strings separated by spaces. Finish it off with a semicolon.

## Getting a little Flexy with Grid

Grid itself can do some of the same vertical and horizontal spacing stuff that Flexbox can do. It uses the properties `justify-items` and `align-items`. But it is important to realize that it is only the thing marked with `display: grid` that has these abilities. The **grid areas** do not implcitly have any of that so if you need flex functionality in any of your grid areas, it's best to mark them as `display: flex` or `display: grid` and then apply your justification to the items therein.
