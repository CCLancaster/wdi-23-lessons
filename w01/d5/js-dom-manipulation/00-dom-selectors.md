### Setup

- We're going to need an _index.html_ for the markup and an _app.js_ for the JS.

- Put _app.js_ into a separate _js_ directory and load it in the `<head>` with a `<script>` element.

- Finally, let's add the boilerplate and an `<h1>` to _index.html_ as follows:

	```html
	...
	<body>
	  <h1 id="title" class="main-title">DOM Selectors</h1>
	  
	</body>
	</html>
	```

---
### Why Select DOM Elements?
<br>

- Web apps today are dynamic - they respond to a user's interaction.

- For example, in a To Do app, the user types a new todo into an input, clicks a button and the new todo is added to the list.

- The above scenario requires the app's JS to:
	-  Attach an event listener to the button element
	-  Grab the text entered from the input element
	-  Create a new element, e.g. an `li`, and set it's content
	-  Append that new element to the list

- JS must be able to select DOM elements so that the above steps can be performed!

---
### Select a single element by its _id_
<br>

- We select a single element by its `id` as follows:

	```js
	var titleEl = document.getElementById('title');
	console.log(titleEl);
	```

- Note that you do not put a # in front of the id name!

- Okay, save and view the page. Yikes! It just logs out `null` - what's wrong?

- The problem is that the script is running **before** the DOM is ready.

- There are a few ways to cure this...

---
### Select a single element by its _id_
<br>

- To fix this problem, we could:
	- Put our code in an event listener that is trigged when the `ondocumentready` event is fired.
	- Assign a function to the `window.onload` property.
	- Or we can simply move our `<script>` element to the bottom of the `<body>` element as follows:

	```html
	<body>
	  <h1 id="title" class="cool">DOM Selectors</h1>
	  
	  <script src="js/app.js"></script>
	</body>
	```

- Until we learn more about events, let's move our `<script>` tag!

---
### Select a single element by its _id_
<br>

- Okay, let's refresh and bam, there's our element in the console!

- If you'd like to be able to explore the properties of element, use `console.dir()` instead.

---
### Select a single element using a CSS selector
<br>

- Using `document.getElementById` is the most common and efficient way to select an element if it has an id.

- However, much of the time, elements will not have an id assigned, so what do we do?

- The solution is to use the `querySelector(selector)` method that is available on the `document` **and** elements themselves.

- The _selector_ is a string that follows the syntax of regular CSS3 selectors - very powerful and flexibile! 

---
### Select a single element using a CSS selector
<br>

- Knowing that the _selector_ provided to `querySelector(selector)` follows the rules of CSS3 selectors, **how can we modify our code to select the `<h1>` element by its id?**

- Since `querySelector()` could match multiple elements, note that it  returns the **first matching** element. If no matching node is found, null is returned.

- You can also call `querySelector()` on an element to search its descendants only!

---
### Practice
<br>

- In _index.html_, add a `<p>` tag with some content below the `<h1>`.  Also, give it the class of _cool_, then...

- Use `querySelector()` to select the first element with a class of _cool_ and log it out.

- **Which element was selected?**

---
### Change the content of an element
<br>

- Now that we are able to select an element, let's see how we can change the content of that element.

- Inspecting the properties in the console, we will find a couple of properties that we can use to read and set content:
	- **`innerHTML`** - Content will be set as HTML
	- **`textContent`** - Content will be set as text

---
### Change the content of an element
<br>

- Let's check out changing content of our `<p>` element by assigning the string **_Comments for \<strong\>Today\</strong\>_** first to `textContent`, then to `innerHTML`.

- So, as you saw, if you want to include HTML in the content, use `innerHTML`.

- The power of `innerHTML` may not be obvious, but consider that the string can be as complex as you want, even containing multiple elements with attributes, etc.

- Using `textContent` is more efficient if just setting text.

---
### Change the style of an element
<br>

- DOM elements also have a `style` property that can be used to get/set CSS styling!

- Check out the CSS properties in the console.

- **What naming convention is used for CSS properties in the DOM?**

- **What naming convention is used for CSS properties in CSS?**

- **Why is it different?**

---
### Change the style of an element

- This is how we can set the `text-align` CSS property of our title:

	```js
	var titleEl = document.getElementById('title');
	titleEl.style.textAlign = 'center';
	```

- **Your turn:** Change the text color of the `<p>` element to green - try to do it in one line of code.

- Note: Setting styles in JS like this is implemented using the `style` attribute (inline styling).

---
### Attributes of an element
<br>

- You may need to get, set, or check if an element has a certain attribute.

- The element's API has several methods to work with attributes:
	- `getAttribute`
	- `setAttribute`
	- `hasAttribute`

- For details, here's a [link to the entire API for elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element).

---
### Review Questions

- **If we want to change text only inside of a `<div>`, what property should we set?**

- **How many DOM elements are returned by the `querySelector` method?**

- **The `querySelector` method is available on the ______ and _______.**

---
### Selecting multiple elements
<br>

- Now let's see how we can grab multiple elements.

- The methods will return either an _HTMLCollection_ or a _nodeList_.  Both are special objects that behaves much like an array.  We will discuss a key difference later.

- Let's add this HTML below the `<p>` element (use Emmet):

	```html
	<ul id="comments">
	  <li class="comment">first comment</li>
	  <li class="comment">second comment</li>
	  <li class="comment">third comment</li>
	</ul>
	```

---
### Selecting multiple elements
<br>

- These methods are used to select multiple elements:
	- `getElementsByTagName()`
	- `getElementsByClassName()`
	- `querySelectorAll()`

- Like `querySelector()`, these methods are available on the `document` object or any element (great for focusing the selection).

- If a method above does not select any elements, it will return an empty array-like collection.<br>**How is this different from what the single-element methods returned?**

---
### Select multiple elements<br>by their tag name
<br>

- The first method we'll look at that selects multiple elements is <br>`getElementsByTagName(name)`

- Let's grab all of our `<li>`s:

	```js
	var comments = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
	console.log(comments);
	```

---
### Select multiple elements by<br>their tag name
<br>

- Now you can access each element using _square bracket notation_ just like on arrays:

	```sh
	> comments[1]
	< ï»¿<li class="comment">second comment</li>
	```

- In a bit, we'll look at how to iterate through the list.

---
### Select multiple elements by their class
<br>

- Just like `getElementsByTagName(name)`, we can use `getElementsByClassName(names)` to select elements, but by their class instead of their tag name.

- Note that if you want to select elements having more than one class, just separate the classes with a space like so:

	```js
	var el = document.getElementsByClassName('menu sidebar');
	```
	Only elements with **both** _menu_ and _sidebar_ will be selected

---
### Select multiple elements with <span style="text-transform:lowercase">query</span>S<span style="text-transform:lowercase">elector</span>A<span style="text-transform:lowercase">ll</span>()
<br>

- Finally, providing maximum flexibility, is the `querySelectorAll` method that uses CSS3's selector language like we saw earlier with the `querySelector` method.

- **Practice:** In the console, use `querySelectorAll()` to select all of the elements with a class of `comment`.

---
### Live vs. non-live (static) lists
<br>

- `querySelectorAll` returns a _nodeList_.

- `getElementsByTagName` and `getElementsByClassName` return an _HTMLCollection_.

- The difference between the two types of array-like objects is that the _HTMLCollection_ is **_live_**, which means the collection is automatically updated as the DOM changes!

---
### Iterating over a collection of elements
<br>

- Unfortunately, both _HTMLCollection_ and _nodeList_ do not have a `forEach` method to iterate over its elements.

- However, a `for` loop's looping variable can be used to index into the list using square bracket notation like this:

	```js
	for(var i = 0; i < comments.length; i++) {
		console.log(comments[i]);
	}
	```

---
### Iterating over a collection of elements using ES2015
<br>

- ES2015 (formerly known as ES6) brings us a better way to iterate:

	```js
	for (let comment of comments) {
		console.log(comment);
	}
	```

- We will be gradually introducing ES2015 features throughout WDI.

---
### Create new DOM elements
<br>

- Let's finally take a look at how to create new DOM elements via Javascript:

	```js
	var listItem = document.createElement("li");
	```

- We use the `document.createElement()` function to create an element.
- It returns the newly created element which we can store in a variable.
- We can now change its style, content, and attributes exactly as above.

---
### Add DOM elements to the document
<br>

- Once we've created the new element and updated its style and content, we can add it to the DOM
- We select the element we want as the parent of the new element
- Then we append the new element to the parent

	```js
  // Select the first `<ul>` in the document
	var ul = document.querySelector("ul");
  // Append the list item to it
  ul.appendChild(listItem);
	```

- The new element will be added as the last element in the parent

---
### Final Questions
<br>

- **Name the two methods that will select a single element from the DOM.**

- **Which one of those can be used on both `document` and individual elements?**

- **Which property on DOM elements contains the CSS properties for that element?**

- **If we wanted to grab all of the content (including its nested elements) of an element as a string, what property would we use?**

- **What two methods provide the most flexibility when selecting a single and multiple elements?**

## Lab

## Selecting from Reddit's DOM

We're going to practice some JavaScript based DOM manipulation and traversal in the browser.

Go to [reddit](http://reddit.com) and open the JavaScript console (cmd + option + j). Then try to complete the following tasks.

#### getElementById

Use `getElementById` to do the following:

* find the page header and change it's background color.
* find the element with the id `header-bottom-right` and change it's html to say "Hello **NAME**" (replace "NAME" with your name and make it bold)


#### getElementsByClassName

Use `getElementsByClassName` to find every thumbnail and resize them to 20x20 pixels. (hint: you'll need to use a loop)


#### getElementsByTagName

Use `getElementsByTagName` to add a red background to all links on the page.


#### querySelector

Use `querySelector` to:

* change the score of the 3rd post on the page.
* change the text in the search box
  * use `.value`


#### querySelectorAll

Use `querySelectorAll` to change (re-number) the ranks of the posts so they start from zero instead of 1. (hint: you'll need to use a loop)

### BONUS: addEventListener

Use `addEventListener` to add a 'click' event to the 'body' tag that changes the background color of the body. (hint: utilize the style property') You will need to look up the syntax for adding an event listener here:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

We will be covering event listeners in the next lesson!
