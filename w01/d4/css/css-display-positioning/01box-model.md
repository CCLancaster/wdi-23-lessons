# The Box Model

Most HTML elements can be considered boxes, or is _living inside a box_.

The CSS box model describes this principal - a box wraps around all HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.  This model allows us to place a border around elements and space elements in relation to other elements.

With CSS properties and values, it is possible to apply specific styles to each of these elements, and change the way they behave and/or display on the page.

The image below illustrates the box model and what you should have seen in your dev tools:

But what do these different layers mean, and how are they relating to one another?

**Margin**
* _outside of the element_
* clears an area around the border
* does NOT have a background color (transparent)

**Border** 
* outside the width and height
* a border that goes around the padding and content;
* it IS affected by the background color of the element

**Padding**
* outside the width and height
* clears an area between the content and the border
* transparent so it takes on the background color of the element

**Content**
* _inside the element_
* width and height properties affect content
* where text and images appear
* affected by the color of the element

## Layers of the Box Model

Let's get go into some more detail and practice with each of these elements of The Box Model.

#### Margin

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.

Let's start with our margins. Adjusting our margins not only moves our element relative to other elements on the page but also relative to the "walls" of the HTML document.

For instance, if we take an HTML element with a specific width (such as our `<div>` in the editor) and set its margin to `auto` - this tells the document to automatically put equal left and right margins on our element, centering it on the page.

If you want to specify a particular margin, to a particular side, you can do it like this:

```css
div {
  margin-top: 1px;
  margin-right: 2px;
  margin-bottom: 3px;
  margin-left: 4px;
}
```

You can also set an element's margins all at once: you just start from the top margin and go around clockwise (going from top to right to bottom to left). For instance,

```css
div {
  margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
}
```

You can do top-bottom and side side - let's add this to our css for now:

```css
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

#### Border

The border is the edge of the element. It's what we've been making visible every time we set the border property.

Borders can be set in two ways, just like your margins and just like we've talked about previously.

```css
div {
  border: 5px solid black;
}

/* OR */

div {
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;
}
```

#### Padding and Content

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border. We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.

Padding can be set in two ways, just like your margins.

```css
div {
  padding: 2px;
}

/* OR */

div {
  padding-top: 3px;
  padding-right: 1px;
  padding-bottom: 0px;
  padding-left: 9px;
}

/* OR */

div {
  padding: 3px 1px 0 9px;
}
```


Padding becomes more apparent when we have "stuff" inside the box.
